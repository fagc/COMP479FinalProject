# COMP479FinalProject

Customer personality analysis is a valuable tool for interpreting a company’s customer base. It helps us identify key traits and behaviors of customers, and businesses can optimize their marketing strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction with the right insights. 

This project will examine the performance of five different models:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Neural Networks
3. Support Vector Machines
4. Perceptron
5. K-means Clustering

All applied to the “Customer Personality Analysis” Dataset available on Kaggle, we compared these models to see which one is the most effective approach for predicting the customers behaviors and reasonings.
